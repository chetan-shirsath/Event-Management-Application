* As a user, I should be able to book events
* As a user, I should get mail of the booked event
* As a user, I should be able create a new event
* As a user, I should be able to update event details, so that correct details can be available to other users.
* As a user, I should be able to delete an event, so that outdated events should not available to other users
* As a user, I should be able to view my respective events in my profile
